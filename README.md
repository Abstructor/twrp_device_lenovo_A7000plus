## Note
- **Development on this device tree has ceased** since I no longer own this device. Feel free to fork and modify this in whatever way you want.  
- The artifact (`recovery.iso`) created from this device tree is confirmed to be working (obtained root via `mtk-easy-su`, flashed it via `Flashify` which is no longer on Play Store).
